MWSFonts
===================

MWSFonts is a simple, Universal, iOS fonts viewer app, written in Swift. 

(I needed a way to quickly preview available native iOS fonts, and I wanted a simple app to learn Swift programming.)

Usage
--------------------
The universal app uses UISplitViewController to display a list of font family names in the master view controller.

- Select a font family: the detail view controller will display a block of text in each of  the fonts in that family.

- Enter your own text in the textfield above the tableView, and hit the keyboard Done key to update the display.

- Use the slider under the fonts tableView to resize the text in the cells.

- The clear text button in the textfield updates the tableView cells with default text.
